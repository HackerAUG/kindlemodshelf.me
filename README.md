- Live preview of your page
- Export as a complete HTML file

**How to create a page:**

## How to Share Your Page

You have multiple options. Pick whichever is easiest for you:

**Option 1: Pull Request (GitHub)**
If you know how to use Git:
1. Fork the repository
2. Add your HTML file to the project
3. Update index.html to link to your page
4. Create a pull request

**Option 2: Email or Direct Message**
If GitHub is too complicated:
1. Create your page with the Page Builder
2. Export the HTML file
3. Email it to us or DM @kindlemodshelfguy on Discord
4. We'll add it to the site for you

Don't worry about naming files, updating sitemap.xml, or any technical stuff. Just send us the file.
