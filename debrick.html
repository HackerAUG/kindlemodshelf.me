    <h1>UNBRICKING A KINDLE</h1>

    <p>Sometimes things go wrong when jailbreaking or messing around. So let's fix it!</p>

    <div class="summary">
      <b>Unbricking a Kindle</b> walks you through confirming whether the device is truly bricked, reviving it with a simple factory restore trigger, and escalating to advanced recovery options when the basics fail.
    </div>

    <section aria-labelledby="prerequisites">
      <h2 class="section-title" id="prerequisites">PREREQUISITES</h2>
      <div class="card card-desc">
        <ul>
          <li>Patience—recovery can take time</li>
          <li>A Windows PC is ideal, but macOS works with the right tools</li>
          <li>Comfort with basic technical troubleshooting</li>
          <li>A USB cable that supports data transfer</li>
          <li><em>Potential experience with soldering and/or disassembling devices</em> <strong>(worst-case scenario)</strong></li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="is-it-bricked">
      <h2 class="section-title" id="is-it-bricked">IS IT ACTUALLY BRICKED?</h2>
      <div class="card card-desc">
        <p>Start with the quickest resets before you assume anything is permanently broken:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Hold the power button for about five seconds. If a restart menu appears, use it and let the Kindle reboot fully.</li>
          <li>If nothing happens—or the Kindle hangs again—press and hold the power button for roughly one minute to force a restart.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If both attempts fail to fix the issue, treat the device as bricked and move to deeper recovery options.</p>
        <p>You now have a few immediate choices:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Let the battery drain completely, then plug the Kindle back in to trigger a cold start <em>(this could take an <strong>extremely</strong> long time)</em>.</li>
          <li>If you are comfortable opening the device, disconnect and reconnect the battery connector before powering back on.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Unless something truly impossible is happening with your hardware, one of these should force a fresh boot cycle.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="accessing">
      <h2 class="section-title" id="accessing">ACCESSING YOUR KINDLE WITH A COMPUTER</h2>
      <div class="card card-desc legal-warning">
        <strong>Important:</strong> If your Kindle never appears on the computer after multiple cables and ports, skip ahead to the <a href="#advanced-steps">advanced steps</a>.
      </div>
      <div class="card card-desc">
        <p>The goal here is to reach the Kindle’s storage over USB so you can trigger a factory restore.</p>
        <h3>PC Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Use a USB cable that you know supports data, not just charging.</li>
          <li>Connect the Kindle to your computer and wait for the storage volume to appear.</li>
          <li>If nothing shows up at first, give it a minute or try a quick restart.</li>
          <li>Once mounted, open the root of the Kindle (where the <code>documents</code> and <code>audible</code> folders live).</li>
          <li>Create an empty file named <code>DO_FACTORY_RESTORE</code> with no extension, then eject and restart the Kindle.</li>
          <li>The device should boot to the initial setup wizard—meaning the brick is cleared.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div class="card card-desc">
        <h3>Mac Instructions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Older, mass-storage Kindles usually behave like on Windows. If yours mounts, follow the PC instructions above.</li>
          <li>For newer MTP-only devices, install either the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/sendtokindle/mac?&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;tag=ter000-20&amp;linkId=07f7c7db67889bf36e836471c479526e&amp;la" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon Send to Kindle app</a> or <a href="https://openmtp.ganeshrvel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenMTP</a>.</li>
          <li>Once the Kindle shows up through that software, you can create <code>DO_FACTORY_RESTORE</code> on the root and restart just like on PC.</li>
        </ul>
